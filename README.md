> Deep in agentic-engineering mode — building AI runtimes, SaaS systems, and local-first tools designed for speed, simplicity, and scale..

I build **AI-native tools, SaaS platforms, and developer utilities** at high velocity.  
My focus is on **agentic systems, local-first tools, and automation software** for real businesses — especially in Southeast Asia.

Previously studied **electronics engineering in Japan**, now building software full-time and running multiple SaaS and product experiments.
